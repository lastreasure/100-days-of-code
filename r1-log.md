## R1D1 - *01.11.22*

Started a GitHub log for the 100DaysOfCode challenge - I'm thinking this counts. Planned some resources and learning for the challenge. Completed a CodeWars challenge. 

### CodeWars
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

```
function squareSum(numbers){
  return numbers.reduce((sum,num) => sum + (num * num), 0);
}
```

## R1D2 - *02.11.22*
